# Employee Insights Dashboard

## This Dashboard Includes Four Tabs

### 1. Line Chart (Trends)
> This tab provides insights into employee trends over the years. It includes a dropdown to select employee status and a range slider to filter data by year. The line chart visualizes the number of employees over time based on the selected criteria.

### 2. Scatter Plot (Correlation)
> This tab allows users to analyze the correlation between productivity percentage and other key variables such as work hours per week, training hours, and monthly income. Users can select the variable to compare via radio buttons, and the scatter plot updates accordingly.

### 3. Interactive Charts
> This tab presents department-wise analysis using interactive charts. A pie chart shows the distribution of employees across departments, and when hovered, it updates a line chart displaying the average monthly income over time for the selected department.

### 4. Interactive Plots (Turnover)
> This tab focuses on employee turnover analysis. It includes a pie chart for employee status distribution, a bar chart showing the number of employees per department based on status, and a line chart that illustrates the average tenure over the years for each department.

**Note:** The dataset used for this dashboard has been preprocessed to ensure accuracy in analysis. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, converting date formats, and filtering data as per user inputs. The dataset file is included, and additional preprocessing can be done in Jupyter Notebook if needed.
